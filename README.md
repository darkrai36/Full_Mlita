This repository was created to systematize absolutely all old problems in mathematical logic.

1) Create class "Main" to check how work primitive code. Print "Hello world!"
2) Create classes "FullMatrix" and "SquareMatrix", where will be all logic **for my matrix calculator.**
3) Add "calculateDeterminant" for calculating determinant :)
