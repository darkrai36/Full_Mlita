This repository was created to systematize absolutely all old problems in mathematical logic.

1) Create class "Main" to check how work primitive code. Print "Hello world!"
2) Create classes "FullMatrix" and "SquareMatrix", where will be all logic **for my matrix calculator.**
3) Add "calculateDeterminant" for calculating determinant :)
4) Delete class 'SquareMatrix' and update 'FullMatrix' - add methods for calculating determinant (task 1) (AGAIN).
5) Add method for solving system of linear equations (Cramer method).
6) Add method for finding product of 2 matrices.
